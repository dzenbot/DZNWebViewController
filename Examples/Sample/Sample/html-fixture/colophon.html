              As a way to kick off this new year, I thought it'd be
              fun to share some insights of just how NSHipster is
              made. This article covers both the website and the
              recently-released NSHipster book, so if you've

            <h2>
              Website
            </h2>
            <p>
              I created NSHipster in July of 2012 in an attempt to
              form a lasting writing habit. I committed to putting
              out a new article each week, and (for the most part)
              I've been able to stick to that. Having a consistent
              deadline keeps me motivated and accountable for
              writing something every week.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's the routine: on Monday mornings I wake up at
              5AM, grab a bottle of Ito En tea, and get to work.
              Knowing that I <em>need</em> to get something out
              then and there allows me to stay focused on the task
              at hand.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Organization: Things.app
            </h3>
            <p>
              The first step is to figure out what to write about.
              I have a list of potential topics stashed away in
              <a href=
              "http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things.app</a>,
              compiled from random ideas I get while programming,
              or while reading through Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a topic in hand, then next step is to find as
              many relevant articles around the web as I can.
              Apple's documentation and guides serve as an outline
              of topics to discuss, while Stack Overflow questions
              serve as data points for where any confusion may lie.
              Any blog posts that come up in search also help to
              highlight any interesting tidbits or tricks.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                And every so often, I'll find that <a href=
                "https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/">Mike Ash has
                already written the definitive blog post</a> on the
                subject, in which case I go back and find a new
                topic.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>
              Writing: TextMate &amp; Markdown
            </h3>
            <p>
              After an hour or so of research on the web and
              experimentation in Xcode, I'll have a basic outline,
              along with a handful of code samples for the article.
              At this point, I have enough to go on for a first
              draft—and more importantly, have sufficiently warmed
              up my writing muscles, so that the words flow a
              little more easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything is written in <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
              allowing me to focus on the content. My non-Xcode
              editor-of-choice is <a href=
              "http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, as it has been
              for nearly a decade.
            </p>
            <p>
              With dozens of articles under my belt at this point,
              I'm able to write comfortably in the familiar voice
              that you've come to expect from NSHipster. Most
              articles start with a philosophical interlude, or
              some background to provide a broader context for that
              week's topic. What follows is a top-level description
              of the class, method, function, project, or language
              feature being discussed, describing what it is, how
              it works, and why it's cool and significant. Each
              section follows in a similar fashion, using code
              samples, figures, and tables to explain each concept.
              Finally, the conclusion aims to wrap up any concepts
              introduced in the beginning, and motivate the reader
              to use what they've learned in their own work.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Editing: Marked.app
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once I've gotten most of the first draft finished,
              I'll throw the markdown file into <a href=
              "http://markedapp.com">Marked</a> to get a sense of
              the final document as it will read on the site. With
              all of the formatting in place, I'm able to get a
              better idea of the actual length and flow of the
              document. The readability tools and Mac OS X's
              built-in grammar and spell check act as a first-pass
              for typos.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Generating: Jekyll &amp; Compass
            </h3>
            <p>
              <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is what
              brings all of the content together to generate the
              final HTML of the site. The <a href=
              "https://github.com/NSHipster/nshipster.com">source
              code for the site</a> has evolved gradually over time
              to incorporate things like <a href=
              "http://nshipster.com/feed.xml">RSS</a>, syndication
              on <a href=
              "https://twitter.com/nshipster">Twitter</a>,
              Facebook, and <a href=
              "https://plus.google.com/+MatttThompson">Google+</a>,
              and full-text search, as well as other best
              practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              For CSS, I use <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_%28stylesheet_language%29">
              Sass</a> &amp; <a href=
              "http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. Once you get
              used to Sass, there's just no going back to doing CSS
              by hand. The site itself is long overdue for a
              re-align, so look forward to that at some point.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Hosting: Amazon S3
            </h3>
            <p>
              I recently switched hosting over from <a href=
              "http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> to <a href=
              "http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. As much as
              I miss ease and simplicity of Heroku's git-based
              deployment, S3 can serve static websites much more
              quickly and inexpensively. Hosting in the
              <code>us-west-2</code> (Oregon) region also lends
              some extra hipster cred, with its relative proximity
              to Portlandia.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use the <code>ALIAS</code> feature of <a href=
              "https://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a> to host the site
              at the Apex domain <code>nshipster.com</code>, rather
              than a <code>CNAME</code> like
              <code>www.nshipster.com</code>. Everything about
              DNSimple has been a dream; I whole-heartedly
              recommend them for as a DNS registrar and nameserver
              provider.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Deploying: s3cmd &amp; Transmit.app
            </h3>
            <p>
              Switching over from Heroku also meant coming up with
              a deployment script. Fortunately, <a href=
              "http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> makes it easy to
              synchronize files from the Jekyll <code>_site</code>
              build folder to my static hosting bucket. (If
              anything goes wrong during deployment, or I need to
              quickly futz around with something in S3 directly,
              <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> is
              my go-to tool).
            </p>
            <p>
              Before sending everything up to S3, I run <a href=
              "http://tidy.sourceforge.net">HTML Tidy</a> (with a
              <a href=
              "https://github.com/NSHipster/nshipster.com/blob/master/tidy.conf">
              highly-customized config file</a> to accomodate
              HTML5), and run my HTML and XML (sitemap &amp; RSS
              feed) through <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip"><code>gzip</code></a>.
              By setting the <code>'Content-Encoding: gzip'</code>
              header on S3, compressed assets can be served
              directly, which <em>dramatically</em> reduces the
              size (and therefore transfer time) for files.
            </p>
            <p>
              All together, the deploy script looks something like
              this:
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">

    find _site/ -iname '*.xml'
        -exec gzip -n --best {} +

    for f in `find _site/ -iname '*.gz'`; do
      mv $f ${f%.gz}
    done

    s3cmd sync --progress -M --acl-public
        --add-header 'Content-Encoding:gzip'
        --exclude '*.*'
        --include '*.html' --include '*.xml'
        --verbose

              Speaking of translation—over the last couple months,
              I've been working with translators to make NSHipster
              more accessible to Chinese-speaking audiences. It's
              still a work in progress, but I'm excited to give you
              <a href="http://nshipster.cn">a sneak peak at what we
              have so far: NSHipster.cn</a>.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>
              Book
            </h2>
            <p>
              Which brings us to the book. <a href=
              "https://gumroad.com/l/nshipster">NSHipster: Obscure
              Topics in Cocoa &amp; Objective-C</a> is the
              culmination of all of my efforts so far with
              NSHipster. It combines articles from the site, along
              with new articles to create an essential resource for
              any aspiring iOS or Mac OS X developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll admit: I had no idea what I was getting myself
              into when I started. Turns out, writing and
              publishing a book is quite a bit different from a
              website. Working in the insulated, digital world of
              technology allows us to momentarily forget about most
              of the sharp edges of the real world. The process of
              writing the book was nothing if not a reality check.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Editing &amp; Layout: Pages.app
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm not proud of my process in creating the book. It
              was a long, manual slog using kludgy tools without
              much of a clue about what I was doing at any step in
              the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, I thought it would be pretty
              straightforward: run the site's articles through
              <a href=
              "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> and
              call it a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nope.
            </p>
            <p>
              After sinking at least 10 hours into hacking and
              tweaking every step of the process, I just wasn't
              able to produce anything that I could be proud of.
              Whether this is the fault of the tooling, or my
              inability to use it correctly, I can't help but
              conclude from my experiences that stylesheets just
              don't cut it when it comes to books: each page spread
              must be designed individually.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, I turned to <a href=
              "http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">InDesign</a>.
              After an hour or two of fiddling with content tools
              and templates, I threw in the towel and decided to
              just use <a href=
              "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12">
              Pages</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, Pages. Seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
              I even specifically upgraded to the latest iWork '13
              version, which turned out to be even less capable
              than its predecessor.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a command-line driven process became
              40 hours of getting to know this WYSIWYG editor. To
              its credit, WYSIWYG can actually be a really nice way
              to design content, as it allows for copy-editing
              decisions to be made in a tight loop with its
              implications on layout. This was especially useful
              when it came to placing <a href=
              "http://www.conorheelan.com">Conor Heelan's</a>
              delightful animal illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Pages, I was able to generate the PDF that is
              available online, as well as the source document for
              the physical book. Even now, I'm still at a loss for
              what would have been a better solution.

              Electronic Publishing: Gumroad
            </h3>
            <p>
              Of all of the options for selling and distributing
              online goods, <a href=
              "https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> is the best. In
              just a few minutes, I was able to put together
              <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/nshipster">an
              attractive listing</a>, with options for pre-sale and
              physical book add-ons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gumroad's dashboard analytics and tools provide an
              attractive view of sales, which was exciting to watch
              in real-time when I first hit publish. The small cut
              they take on each sale to host and handle payment
              (including international and state sales tax) was
              well worth it. I'll definitely be working with
              Gumroad again for my next project.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Physical Publishing &amp; Fulfillment: CreateSpace
            </h3>
            <p>
              The good news: it's never been easier to self-publish
              a book.<br>
              The bad news: parts of it are still a pain in the
              ass.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's how I did it:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Create an account with <a href=
                "https://www.createspace.com">CreateSpace</a></strong>.
                As I understand it, Amazon effectively cornered the
                market of <a href=
                "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand">Print
                on Demand</a> by acquiring this company and buying
                all of the book printers it could find.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Create a new title</strong>. In this case,
                it was a trade paperback book (6" × 9").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Purchase ISBNs from <a href=
                "https://www.myidentifiers.com">Bowker</a></strong>.
                Since a unique <a href=
                "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">
                ISBN</a> is required for each retail
                distribution—including one for each digital format
                (PDF, epub, Kindle Mobi, iBooks)—I bought a 10
                pack. (Don't bother buying a barcode, those can be
                easily generated for free elsewhere)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Create the cover and internal
                content</strong>. CreateSpace has some pretty
                decent tools for proofing content. They were able
                to find issues with margin and bleed before sending
                out for a physical proof.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Behold your book, <a href=
                "http://amzn.to/1cZBq78">now available for sale on
                Amazon</a></strong>. It's an incredible feeling,
                <a href=
                "http://nshipster.s3.amazonaws.com/nshipster-books-box.jpg">
                holding something you've created in your hands</a>.
                This alone made everything worth it. CreateSpace
                offers impressive wholesale price for a physical
                book (between $10–15 for printing a book and
                shipping domestically or internationally)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Here's where I messed up:
            </p>
            <p>
              Because I did a pre-order for physical books through
              Gumroad, it was up to me to translate those into
              wholesale orders from CreateSpace. Unfortunately,
              CreateSpace had no mechanism for bulk ordering
              online, and their support staff were unable to
              process that themselves. Their recommendation: go
              through the checkout process manually for each of the
              1000+ orders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yikes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, this was the one part of the book
              writing process I <em>was</em> able to automate.
              Using <a href=
              "http://mechanize.rubyforge.org">Mechanize</a>, I was
              able to write a Ruby script to go through each order,
              one-by-one, and manually create an order for each.
              Because the user input wasn't 100% correctly
              formatted, I had to keep watch over the script as it
              ran, ready to fix any errors as they came up.
              <strong>The process took the better part of two
              days</strong>. I'll try to get that cleaned up and
              packaged into a proper Ruby library soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some other fun facts:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I ran into the outgoing SMTP limit for my Gmail
              account, forcing me to create and send from several
              email aliases.
              </li>
              <li>I used Numbers.app to clean up the
              <code>.csv</code> file provided by Gumroad, but
              because of its <em>delightful</em> insistence on
              automatically formatting postal codes as numbers,
              anything with a leading zero got screwed up.
              NSHipsters in Massachusetts: I love you, but you were
              the bane of my existence for an afternoon.
              </li>
              <li>For a while, each error would silently create an
              order sent to my house. That was the first time a bug
              has so directly translated into a monetary cost for
              me. For fun, I added an <code>afplay
              cha-ching.aiff</code> after each order from that
              moment on.
              </li>
              <li>At some point, the script started to fail
              silently because an order to the Ukraine triggered a
              fraud warning for my American Express card. Thanks to
              their amazing customer support, I was able to get
              everything running smoothly within 5 minutes.

              Inspiration
            </h3>
            <p>
              So why did I write the book, anyway? There are 3
              primary reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>To Craft a Structured Narrative</strong>:
                NSHipster.com has built up its archive
                week-by-week, and is likewise organized by its
                particular chronology. And though articles are
                organized by topic in a long footer, it can be
                difficult for new readers to know where to start. A
                book allows for a linear narrative structure in a
                way that a blog simply cannot. A great deal of care
                was put into structuring the content in the book
                according to a logical progression, such that one
                could read from start to finish. There are also a
                number of articles that are exclusive to the book,
                dealing primarily with the cultural and emotional
                aspects of coding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>To Provide Something Tangible</strong>:
                It's been amazing to see how much readers have
                related to NSHipster. A tangible object like a book
                offers a tangible <em>something</em> that you can
                be proud of and cherish. It also creates a tangible
                means of supporting the site, in the same way that
                one might for a favorite <a href=

                <strong>To Change My Life</strong>: Last week, on
                New Year's Eve, I married the most amazing person
                I've ever met. Thanks to your generous support, she
                and I are able to start our lives together
                comfortably, with something set aside for a house
                downpayment in the future (as well as a lovely
                honeymoon in Hawaii; I get back later this week). I
                can't begin to express my gratitude for all of the
                blessings I've had in my work. Thank you.
